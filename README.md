# MCLP-GA
Genetic Algorithm for Maximal Covering Location Problem
Facility location models have been a fundamental research area among the practitioners and scholars.Brandeau and Chiu (1989), 
Revelle and Eiselt (2005) and and Daskin (2008) provide a detailed introduction of facility location problems and explains 
each of its application areas. One of the famous facility location problems is the covering location problems (CLP) as 
it has wide area of applications in public and private sectors, including locating warehouses, sensors in wireless networks,
fire stations, pump stations, schools, emergency centers, and etc.In this study we propose a modified version of 
genetic algorithm (GA) to solve the MCLP for large instances. GA is known to be one of the powerful tools that is able to solve 
NP-hard problems in reasonable computational times while yielding near-optimal solutions.
